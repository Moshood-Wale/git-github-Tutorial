# Continuous Integration and Deployment
## Overview
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (CI) and deploying those changes to production environment (CD). Setting up CI/CD pipelines streamlines development workflows, improve code quality, and enables faster delivery of software updates.

## Continuous Integration (CI):
`CI` is the practice of automating the integration of code changes into a shared repository frequently, typically several times a day.

- Benefits:
* Early detection ofintegration errors.
* Faster feedback loops for developers.
* Improved code quality and stability.

- Setting Up CI:
* Choose a CI service or tool (e.g., Jenkins, Gitlab CI, Github Actions).
* Configure your CI pipeline to trigger on code changes to your repository.
* Define stages for building, testing and deploying your application.
* Write automated tests to validate changes before merging them into the main branch.

## Continuous Deployment (CD):
`CD`is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production or staging environments after passing through the CI process.

- Benefits:
* Faster delivery of features and bug fixes.
* Reduced manual intervention and deployment errors.
* Increased confidence in the release process.

- Setting Up CD:
* Extend your CI pipeline to include deployment stages after successful testing.
* Configure deployment scripts or tools to deploy your application to production or staging environments.
* Implement strategies for blue-green deployments, canary releases, or feature flags to minimize the impact of deployments on users.

### How to Set Up CI/CD Pipeline:
1. Choose a CI/CD Tool:
    - Evaluate different CI/CD tools based on your project requirements, budget, and team preferences.
    - Popular options include CircleCI, Travis CI, Gitlab CI/CD, Jenkins amd Github Actions.
<!-- Please note we will be working with Github Actions as our CI/CD tool in this tutorial -->
2. Configure CI Pipeline:
    - Setup your CI pipeline to trigger on code changes to your repository.
    - Define stages for building, testing and validating your application.
    - Configure automated tests to run against your application, including unit tests, integration tests 
      and end-end tests.
3. Configure CD Pipeline:
    - Extend your CI pipeline to include deployment stages after successful testing.
    - Configure deployment scripts
    - Implement strategies to monitor deployment success or failures.
4. Monitor and Iterate:
    - Collect metrics on build times, test coverage, deployment frequency, and deployment success rate.
    - Iterate on your CI/CD pipeline based on feedback and lessons learned to improve its effectiveness 
      over time.

<!-- I will now illustrate an example GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD  -->

The sample Github Actions workflow triggers on pushes to the `main` branch,
runs tests using pytest, and deploys the application to staging if the code changes
are on the `main` branch.

<!-- Next steps for practical purposes, we will create a simple django application and set up a CI/CD pipeline for it using Github Actions. -->

<!-- I will update the remote master branch with the changes on this branch, this will inturn create a need for synchronization between the remote master branch and the local branch-synchronization branch. -->
